## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### ✅ **No Data Leakage**
Run this to verify:
```bash
py check_leakage.py
```
Output shows we removed all "cheating" features like:
- `koi_score` (exoplanet probability - LEAKAGE!)
- `koi_fpflag_*` (false positive flags - LEAKAGE!)
- `kepler_name` (only confirmed planets have names - LEAKAGE!)

### ✅ **Physics-Based Features**
We don't just use raw data. We engineer features based on astrophysics:
- Transit duty cycle (duration/period ratio)
- Stellar density consistency
- Habitability zone indicators
- Signal quality metrics
- Planet size categories

### ✅ **State-of-the-Art ML**
- Ensemble of 8 models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
- Stacking with meta-learner
- Cross-validation to prevent overfitting
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- Optimized decision threshold

### ✅ **Production Ready**
- Complete web interface
- API endpoints for programmatic access
- Comprehensive error handling
- Documentation
- Easy deployment

## 🔍 Feature Engineering Examples

### **Transit Physics**:
```python
# Duty cycle - real planets have specific ranges
transit_duty_cycle = transit_duration / orbital_period

# Stellar density from Kepler's 3rd law
stellar_density = calculate_from_orbit(period, semi_major_axis)
```

### **Habitability**:
```python
# Is this planet in the habitable zone?
in_habitable_zone = (temp >= 200K) & (temp <= 400K)
is_earth_size = (radius >= 0.5) & (radius <= 2.0)
```

### **Signal Quality**:
```python
# High confidence signals
high_snr = signal_to_noise > 10
many_transits = num_transits >= 3
```
