# How to Use the Exoplanet Detection Web App

## Quick Start Guide

### Server Running at: http://localhost:5000

## Problem You Had (SOLVED!)

**Issue**: You uploaded the full `kepler_exoplanets.csv` (9,564 rows) for prediction, which:
- Tried to generate 9,564 light curves
- Tried to calculate 9,564 habitability scores
- Took too long and timed out

**Solution**:
1. Created **smaller demo files** for different purposes
2. Limited predictions to 100 samples max
3. Disabled visualizations for large batches (>10 samples)

---

## Proper Workflow

### Step 1: Train the Model

**Go to**: "Train Model" tab

**Upload**: `data/kepler_exoplanets.csv` (or `demo_data/kepler_train.csv`)
- This is your **training data**
- 9,564 samples (or 7,651 if using train split)
- Contains labeled exoplanets

**Settings**:
- Model Type: `xgboost` or `lightgbm` (recommended)
- Test Size: `0.2`
- Use SMOTE: ✅ Checked

**Click**: "Train Model"

**Wait**: ~2-3 minutes

**Result**: You'll see metrics like:
```
Accuracy: 89.36%
Precision: 84.27%
Recall: 81.45%
F1 Score: 82.83%
ROC AUC: 96.35%
```

---

### Step 2: Test with Visualizations (RECOMMENDED FOR DEMO)

**Go to**: "Predictions" tab

**Upload**: `demo_data/demo_10_samples.csv`
- Only **10 samples**
- All are confirmed exoplanets
- Will show **full visualizations**!

**Click**: "Predict"

**See**:
- ✅ Individual predictions with confidence
- ✅ Discovery Report (NASA-style press release)
- ✅ Habitability Score with gradient bar
- ✅ **Transit Light Curve** (shows brightness dips)
- ✅ **Planet Comparison Chart** (vs Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter)

**This is perfect for JUDGES and DEMOS!**

---

### Step 3: Batch Predictions (Testing Performance)

**Go to**: "Predictions" tab

**Upload**: `demo_data/test_100_samples.csv`
- 100 samples
- Mix of exoplanets and non-exoplanets
- Fast predictions

**Click**: "Predict"

**See**:
```
Batch Prediction Summary
Total Samples: 100
Exoplanets Found: 42
Non-Exoplanets: 58
Avg Confidence: 87.3%

Note: Visualizations disabled for large batches (>10 samples)
Showing first 100 of 100 predictions
```

**Use this** to show the model works at scale!

---

### Step 4: Cross-Dataset Validation (BONUS)

**Train on**: `demo_data/kepler_train.csv`

**Test on**: `demo_data/kepler_test.csv`

**Shows**: Model generalizes to unseen data from same mission

**OR**

**Train on**: Kepler data

**Test on**: TESS data (if you have `data/tess_toi.csv`)

**Shows**: Model works across different telescopes!

## File Guide

### Training Data (Upload to "Train Model" tab)
- `data/kepler_exoplanets.csv` - Full Kepler dataset (9,564 samples)
- `demo_data/kepler_train.csv` - 80% split (7,651 samples)

### Prediction Data (Upload to "Predictions" tab)

**For Visualizations (≤10 samples)**:
- `demo_data/demo_10_samples.csv` - **10 handpicked exoplanets**
  - Light curves ✅
  - Habitability ✅
  - Discovery stories ✅
  - Comparison charts ✅

**For Batch Testing (11-100 samples)**:
- `demo_data/test_100_samples.csv` - **100 mixed samples**
  - Summary statistics ✅
  - Fast predictions ✅
  - No visualizations (too slow)

**For Large-Scale Testing**:
- `demo_data/kepler_test.csv` - **1,913 samples**
  - Shows first 100 predictions
  - Summary for all samples

## Why This Workflow?

### Problem with Your Original Approach:
```
Train: kepler_exoplanets.csv (9,564 rows)
Test:  kepler_exoplanets.csv (SAME 9,564 rows)
```

**Issues**:
1. Testing on training data = overfitting
2. 9,564 light curves = timeout
3. Doesn't show generalization

### Proper ML Workflow:
```
Train: kepler_train.csv (7,651 rows) - 80% of data
Test:  kepler_test.csv (1,913 rows)  - 20% unseen data

Demo:  demo_10_samples.csv (10 rows) - Show visualizations to judges
```

**Benefits**:
1. ✅ No data leakage (train ≠ test)
2. ✅ Fast predictions with visualizations
3. ✅ Shows true model performance
4. ✅ Perfect for demo/presentation

## Manual Prediction (Single Planet)

**Go to**: "Predictions" tab → "Manual Input"

**Enter values** like:
- Period: 365 days
- Radius: 1.0 Earth radii
- Temperature: 288 K
- Star Temp: 5778 K

**Click**: "Predict"

**Get**: Full analysis with visualizations for this one planet!

## Visualizations Tab

**After training**, go to "Visualizations" tab:

**View**:
- Model Performance Metrics (bar chart)
- Confusion Matrix (heatmap)
- Feature Importance (top 15 features)

## Summary: What to Upload Where

| Tab | Upload | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **Data Upload** | `kepler_exoplanets.csv` | Analyze dataset stats |
| **Train Model** | `kepler_train.csv` | Train ML model |
| **Predictions** | `demo_10_samples.csv` | **DEMO with visuals** ⭐ |

## Tips for Judges/Demo

1. **Start with training** on full `kepler_exoplanets.csv`
   - Shows scientific rigor
   - Gets ~89% accuracy, 96% ROC AUC

2. **Demo predictions** with `demo_10_samples.csv`
   - Shows beautiful visualizations
   - Light curves make it tangible
   - Discovery stories engage audience

3. **Show batch capability** with `test_100_samples.csv`
   - Proves scalability
   - Summary statistics impressive

4. **Explain the science**:
   - Point to light curve and say "see the dip? That's the planet!"
   - Show habitability score: "this planet scores 0.77/1.00"
   - Read discovery story: makes it accessible

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Making predictions..." stuck**:
- Your file is too large (>10 samples)
- Visualizations are disabled automatically
- Wait for summary to appear (~30 seconds for 100 samples)

**No light curves shown**:
- You uploaded >10 samples
- This is intentional (would timeout)
- Use `demo_10_samples.csv` to see visualizations

**Error: No trained model**:
- Go to "Train Model" tab first
- Upload data and train before predicting

---

## Ready to Go!

Your app is running at: **http://localhost:5000**

**Recommended demo flow**:
1. Upload `kepler_exoplanets.csv` to Train tab → Train
2. Upload `demo_10_samples.csv` to Predict tab → Predict
