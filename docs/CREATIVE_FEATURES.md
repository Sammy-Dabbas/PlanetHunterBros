## 1. 🌍 **Habitability Scoring System** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**What It Does**:
Calculates how suitable each discovered exoplanet is for life!

**Features**:
- **Earth Similarity Index (ESI)** - Scientific metric (0-1)
- **Habitable Zone Detection** - Is it in the "Goldilocks zone"?
- **Planet Classification** - Earth-like, Super-Earth, Mini-Neptune, etc.
- **Stellar Habitability** - Is the host star suitable?
- **Orbital Stability** - Circular orbit = stable climate
- **Overall Score** - Weighted combination of all factors

**Output Example**:
```
Planet: Kepler-442b
Overall Score: 0.77/1.00
Classification: [HABITABLE] Potentially Habitable
Assessment: Good prospects for habitability

Components:
  Earth Similarity Index: 0.85
  Habitable Zone: Conservative HZ
  Size Category: Super-Earth
  Stellar Type: Orange Dwarf (K-type)
  Orbital Type: Circular (Stable)

Comparison: As habitable as early Earth
```

**Why It's Creative**:
- Goes beyond just "is it a planet?" to "could life exist there?"
- Uses real astrophysics (ESI formula from published research)
- Provides context ("similar to early Earth")
- Makes discoveries more exciting and relatable

**API Endpoint**:
```
POST /api/habitability
Body: { planet properties }
Returns: Habitability assessment
```
