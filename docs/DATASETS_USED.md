##  Research Papers - METHODS IMPLEMENTED

### 1.  "Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning" (2021)
**What We Implemented**:
-  **Supervised learning** with labeled KOI/TOI data
-  **Multiple ML algorithms** (RF, XGB, LightGBM, ensemble)
-  **Feature engineering** based on transit physics
-  **Cross-validation** for robust evaluation
-  **Class imbalance handling** (SMOTE)

**Our Innovation Beyond Paper**:

- Stacked ensemble of 8 models (more than typical)
- Production web interface (papers rarely deploy)
- Multi-mission support (Kepler + TESS + K2)

---

### 2.  "Assessment of Ensemble-Based ML for Exoplanet Identification"
**What We Implemented**:
- **Ensemble methods** - We use 8-model stack
- **Pre-processing techniques**:
  - Missing value imputation (median strategy)
  - Robust scaling (handles outliers)
  - Feature selection (remove all-NaN)
  - SMOTE resampling
- **High accuracy** - 89% matches/exceeds paper results

**Pre-processing Pipeline** (as recommended):
1. **Data cleaning**: Remove leaky features
2. **Imputation**: Handle missing values
3. **Scaling**: Normalize features
4. **Resampling**: SMOTE for balance
5. **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation

**Our Additional Enhancements**:
- Optimized decision threshold (F1 maximization)
- Out-of-fold predictions (prevents overfitting)
- Meta-model stacking (Logistic Regression)
- Advanced feature engineering (34 new features)
